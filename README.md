# TIHKR (Tutor, I Hardly Know Her)

Tutor, I Hardly Know Her (TIHKR) is a full stack app that arranges online tutoring sessions between users and tutors. First, users and tutors register to the system so they can access the app features. For tutors, they will have a profile to enter their available days and hours, subject list, and biography page. Once logged in, the home page features a list of upcoming appointments and additionally for users, a favorite tutors list. The search page displays a simple search option where users find a list of available tutors in an organized manner. Users can filter out their search results based on the tutorsâ€™ names and subjects. When finding a match, the user can book an appointment with the tutor. The user can also add a tutor to their favorites list from the search page. The total tutoring hours will show for both users and tutors.
